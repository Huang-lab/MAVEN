# MAVEN v1.0.0

<span style="font-size:20px"> MAVEN is a machine learning model trained to predict variant effects on protein stability and function. MAVEN is trained with labels generated from Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect (MAVE) along with various evolutionary, structural, and amino acid physiochemical features.</span>
